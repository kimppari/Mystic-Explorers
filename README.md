# Mystic-Explorers

Mystic Explorer is a fantasy MMORPG project that has been inspired by the Korean based MMORPG Fly For Fun (Flyff).

This project main goal is to teach/inspire new game developers and interact with the community around Flyff. It will be 100% community driven with a final goal for launch via Stream (most likely). 

The game will be build using Unity's new ECS (at this current moment 27/07/2020 still in early developement) and the networking side will be done with SmartFoxServer.

Keep in mind that this is a long-term project (2-3 years time if everything goes smoothly).

This is NOT a private server and is NOT going to be a recreation of Flyff. It is simply inspired by the design and the idea behind it.

If you want to contribute to the project by offering your ideas, submitting scripts, textures, visual art and etc you are more than welcome. NO FUNDING will be accepted.
